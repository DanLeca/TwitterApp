TwitterApp
==========================
Application built for a project
Android + Java built

Open source libraries used
==========================
Lottie - Login screen
Stylable toast - Notifications

==========================
Finished the application to an adequate standard. An interesting look into how rest api's work. May return to the application in the future. Came out with a greater understanding of views, interfaces and API calls.

Ultimately fell down with the understanding of interacting with the timeline and the way the XML documents work. 
Struggled with being able to implement:
Profile page with the information of the user
Interactions with the tweet - Visually + not built into timeline

==========================
